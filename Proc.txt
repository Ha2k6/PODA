Here is the **simplest AF guide** to start using **Docker**.
No confusion, no extra theory — just basics that actually work.

---

# ✅ **1. Install Docker**

Download from here:
[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Install → Open Docker Desktop → Done.

---

# ✅ **2. Check if Docker works**

Open terminal / CMD:

```
docker --version
```

and

```
docker run hello-world
```

If it prints “Hello from Docker!”, you're ready.

---

# ✅ **3. Run ANY app in Docker**

Example: run an Ubuntu container:

```
docker run -it ubuntu
```

You are now *inside* Ubuntu.

Exit:

```
exit
```

---

# ✅ **4. Run a Python app in Docker**

```
docker run -it python
```

This gives you a Python shell inside a container.

---

# ✅ **5. Build your own Docker image**

Create a folder:

```
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Make a simple Python file:

**app.py**

```python
print("Hello from Docker!")
```

Make a **Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
FROM python
COPY app.py .
CMD ["python","app.py"]
```

Build it:

```
docker build -t myapp .
```

Run it:

```
docker run myapp
```

✅ Output:

```
Hello from Docker!
```

---

# ✅ **6. See running containers**

```
docker ps
```

See stopped + running:

```
docker ps -a
```

---

# ✅ **7. Stop a container**

```
docker stop CONTAINER_ID
```

---

# ✅ **8. Remove a container/image**

Remove container:

```
docker rm CONTAINER_ID
```

Remove image:

```
docker rmi IMAGE_NAME
```

---

# ✅ Docker in 1 sentence

Docker = runs your apps inside small isolated environments called **containers**.

---

If you want, I can give you:
✅ a **simple Flask app in Docker**
✅ a **simple Node.js / Java / C app in Docker**
✅ a **simple Docker Compose file**

Just tell me which one.
